   - `npx playwright install`

## Task

1. Set up ESLint using instructions given in the theory:

   - Run the `npx eslint` command and make sure you see the list of errors.
   - Fix all bugs in the code.

2. Set up Prettier using the instructions given in the theory section.
3. Set up Husky and Lint-Staged using instructions given in the theory section.
